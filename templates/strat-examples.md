### Forest Temple Floormaster with Hover Boots

It is possible to reach the room on the Forest Temple courtyard balcony - which contains a Floormaster guarding a check (a small key in the vanilla game) - from the large block push room in the center of the dungeon.
To do this, you climb up to the first floor (where the blue/green push block is) and use the Hover Boots to reach the door inside the alcove. 
Not only is this useful if you want to avoid rotating the first hallway multiple times, but it can also be logically required.

---
> Important Note: There are rare cases in which it is possible to find your first Strength Upgrade on the abovementioned check, since this quirk does not really count as a trick for some reason and thus is in logic for the randomizer. This is colloquially called "Hovers locked Forest" and though very rare still important to know.

### King Zora Skip

It is possible to jump over the fence next to King Zora as an adult, thus avoiding either the requirement for Rutos Letter completely or at least avoiding having to come back as a child to hand in the letter and make him slide over and then come back as an adult to walk past him into Zora Fountain and Ice Cavern.
