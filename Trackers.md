# Trackers

Successful completion of an OoT Randomizer run usually means you will have to search a lot of locations and find items to fill your inventory and successfully complete dungeons. We call these locations where these important items (or chests containing them) can be found "checks".

To keep track of the items as well as the locations and maybe even additional information, it can be highly beneficial to utilize a tracker software. The [ootrandomizer.com Wiki](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Trackers) lists all the trackers currently known to the community together with screenshots and links to their respective sources.

A short overview of the possible types of trackers is posted here, together with a short hint on the benefits of the type to help with the selection. 

### Item Trackers

Item trackers are the most basic trackers, allowing you to simply switch on or off the specific items you have already collected so you can view them on your screen without stopping your game and having to open the menu. Many of the more complex tracker types listed below include an item tracker.

If you just want to see what you have and not much else, this tracker type is for you.

### Map Trackers

Map trackers provide a map of Hyrule and the dungeons, listing exactly where each check can be found. They can be highly beneficial in a lot of different cases and play styles. 

This is useful if you are new to the game and not yet familiar with all the possible locations, haven't played the game in a long time and need a refresher, trying out another type of randomizer settings that introduce checks you haven't done before or just don't want to accidentally forget a check somewhere and be on the safe side. 

### Check Trackers

Check trackers are the simpler cousin of map trackers. They list the checks - mostly in a tabular manner - to just tick them off once they're done. 

If you want the "don't forget" convenience of a map tracker but not the space or clicking around involved in a graphical map, this tracker type can be right for you.

### Entrance Tracker

Entrance trackers allow you to map locations to certain entrances. This is highly useful in all kinds of entrance randomizer settings and allows you to keep track of which door leads to which part of the world.

If you play with overworld, grotto or interior entrance randomizer and don't want to map it out in your head or smear it on paper, this tracker type will be of use to you.
