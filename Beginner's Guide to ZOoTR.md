This resource is supposed to help new players getting started on the Ocarina of Time Randomzier and provide an overview on where to get started. It is not supposed to duplicate resources found elsewhere but instead reference pre-existing works and make it easier to find what you search for.

## Part 1: Finding your base

### Defining your Goal

The most important first step is determining what _your_ personal goal is when playing randomizer: 
- Do you want to just have fun and enjoy your favourite game from your childhood?
- Do you want to be competitive and as fast as possible and participate in tournaments?
- Do you just want to try it out and then later see where the mood takes you? 

All are valid approaches but might influence where you find the most valuable resources in the beginning. And finding the right resources for what you might want first so you can have the most enjoyable experience possible is the main goal of this guide.

### Community

There are several [[Communities]] built around OoT and its randomizers. It is not required to join them to be able to play and enjoy the Ocarina of Time Randomizer, but there are a lot of people always willing and enjoying to help new or re-emerging players. So if you are searching for resources or have questions, you're very much invited to drop in there and be helped.

Running tournament races and sometimes friendly races are re-streamed on their respective twitch channels, which can also be found under [[Communities]]. Even if you have no interest in running in those races yourself, the races are always re-streamed live with a commentary and the commentators do their best to explain what's happening on screen. More often than not, questions about what you see posted in twitch chat will be answered by them live and on screen. If the commentators cannot answer the question or it is better explained in a video, other participants in the twitch chat will happily provide links to clips or instructional videos.
