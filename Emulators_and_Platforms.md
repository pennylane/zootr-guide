# Emulators and Platforms

This section is dedicated to helping you find the resources available to play and making an informed choice on which is the best for your personal playstyle.

## Acquisition of the Base Rom

For every possible setup variation - no matter if you're going to play on emulator, virtual console or otherwise - the base rom is a necessary requirement. However, this is strictly copyrighted, so the only legal method to obtain such a rom is to own the correct game cartridge and dump the image to a virtual backup copy which you are allowed to create of your own property.

As such, please refrain from asking people to send you such files, because all the discord communities are bound to refuse this for obvious legal reasons. However, asking for general resources on the topic of e.g. ROM dumping on these channels is strictly recommended because the experienced runners can provide you with helpful technical pointers ;-)

## Choice of Platform / Emulator

The list of Emulators in the [ootrandomizer.com Wiki](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Setup#Emulators) contains links to their respective concise setup guides, tailored directly at their usage as platform for OoTR.

Setup guides for the Wii(U) Virtual console can also be found in the [ootrandomizer.com Wiki](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Setup#Wii_Virtual_Console).

There are, however, several factors that (should) influence your choice of game environment:

### Availability of Resources 

Playing on a console or emulator is not only a matter of choice but can also be a matter of money. Most emulators run well on very basic PC infrastructure, while playing on a Wii or even original N64 requires the use of additional technology if you want to be able to play in races. Playing (or more precisely, racing) on a device that is not a generic computer requires the use of a reliable video (and audio) capture card - if you already own the console itself, that is. These factors mean a significant amount of money having to be invested, so many players prefer the use of an emulator for that reason alone. 

### Place of Play

Playing on a large console requires you to be at home to play or at least results in more logistical challenges if you want to play on the road. Emulators might arguably have less "flair" but can be taken anywhere you can take your laptop. Certain emulators can also run on portable gaming devices like the Steam Deck, ROG Ally or similar.

### Platform of your PC/Device

Some emulators only run on Windows, others also on Mac and Linux systems or even Android and iOS. 

A list of Emulators, their supported platforms is available in the [ootrandomizer.com Wiki](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Setup#Emulators).


### Choice of Controller

Choosing the right controller is important. See [[Controllers]] for more information on the topic. 

If you have a favourite controller you want to use, it is important to check if it will work correctly. 
For example, if you want to use a USB-connected controller, your desired platform or console should have the required ports. If you want to use a bluetooth controller, keep in mind that the bluetooth standards of Nintendo devices and pc platforms differ and you might need additional adapters that cost additional money, introduce connection issues or latency. 


### Desired Visuals

Keep in mind that Ocarina of Time is a game that was originally released in 1998. As such it does not have the visuals that compare to today's games. For participation in tournaments using higher resolution textures or similar might be forbidden.

If you don't care about racing and want to enjoy the game with the highest possible visual fidelity and utilize mods like high resolution texture packs, lighting reworks or high resolution assets the OoT Randomizer might not be your platform of choice. 

Try taking a look at [Ship of Harkinian](https://www.shipofharkinian.com) or [ModLoader64](https://modloader64.com). Please keep in mind though, that these come with their own randomizer engines and are not the same as the OoT Randomizer. As such you will find no in-depth resources here. You will, however, find similar suitable resources in their respective communities: [Ship of Harkinian Discord](https://discord.com/invite/shipofharkinian) & [ModLoader64 on Discord](https://discord.gg/nHb4fXX).


### Multiworld Participation

Some mods allow the playing of so called "Multiworlds". These are game variations in which you play with friends in a way where each player has their own world and inventory, but items you find are either for yourself or a friend.

Due to the complex nature of this mod, the possible platforms are severely more limited than for all other randomizer play. More details on setup and allowed platforms can be found in the [ootrandomizer.com Wiki](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Multiworld).
